## Types of CTFs
As crazy as hacking can get, so can get the competitions. CTFs are based on various formats. Each format has its own timeline, skillset and

### Jeopardy
Yes somewhat similar to [the show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!). These can be considered similar to programming contests as all the competiting teams do not attack each other, but rather solve challenges.  
Each challenge has its own weightage in terms of points. Once a team solve a challenge, they are awarded the assigned number of points for the challenge.  
These kind of CTFs are the most common. One can typically find atleast two jeopardy style ctfs each [weekend](https://ctftime.org/event/list/upcoming)  
[picoCTF](https://picoctf.com/) is one notable example and servers are always (hopefully) up.
A jeopardy ctf event typically spans two days but there are events which may span weeks or maybe months.  

### Attack Defence CTFs
In an attack/defense style competitions, each team is given a machine (or a small network) to defend, typically on an isolated competition network.  
Teams are scored on both their success in defending their assigned machine(s) and on their success in attacking the other team's machines. A variation from classic flag-stealing is to "plant" own flags on opponent's machines.  
These kinds of events are less frequent and typically run only for a few hours.

### King Of The Hill
King of the Hill (KoTH), as the name suggests, is a competitive hacking game, where teams compete against other teams to compromise a machine and then patch its vulnerabilities to stop other players from also gaining access.  
The longer a team maintains access, the more points it gets.  
These are typically very short (typically an hour) and have strong emphasis on penetration testing.  
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/games/koth) has been promoting these events and one can join a game every 15 minutes!
