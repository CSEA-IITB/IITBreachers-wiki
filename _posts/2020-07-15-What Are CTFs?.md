# What Are CTFs?
CTF or [Capture The Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security) in context of computer security, are special kind of information security competitions which serve as a gamified educational exercise to give participants experience in securing a machine as well as conducting and reacting to sort of attacks found in real world or some (supposedly) fun programming concept otherwise.

## What are Flags which we are capturing?
Flags are often secret strings hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs, websites or challenges. The challengers have to steal/hack the flag from the organizers of CTF event (as in Jepoardy format) or from other challengers (attack/defence format). The flags serve as a currency or proof of work for solving a given challenge which one can exchange for points :wink:  
A typical flag may look like `flag{s0m3_puN_0r_c0mm3n7_r3l473d_70_7h3_ch4ll3n63}`

## Types of CTFs
As crazy as hacking can get, so can get the competitions. CTFs are based on various formats. Each format has its own timeline, skillset, category and difficulty of interest.

### Jeopardy
Yes somewhat similar to [the show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!). These can be considered similar to programming contests as all the competiting teams do not attack each other, but rather solve challenges.  
Each challenge has its own weightage in terms of points. Once a team solve a challenge, they are awarded the assigned number of points for the challenge.  
The points for a challenge are either pre-defined by the organizers based on difficulty or can be dynamically decreasing with the number of solves.  
These kind of CTFs are the most common. One can typically find atleast two jeopardy style ctfs each [weekend](https://ctftime.org/event/list/upcoming)  
[picoCTF](https://picoctf.com/) is one notable example and servers are always (hopefully) up.
A jeopardy ctf event typically spans two days but there are events which may span weeks or maybe months.  

### Attack Defence CTFs
In an attack/defense style competitions, each team is given a machine (or a small network) to defend, typically on an isolated competition network.  
Teams are scored on both their success in defending their assigned machine(s) and on their success in attacking the other team's machines. A variation from classic flag-stealing is to "plant" own flags on opponent's machines.  
These kinds of events are less frequent and typically run only for a few hours.

### King Of The Hill
King of the Hill (KoTH), as the name suggests, is a competitive hacking game, where teams compete against other teams to compromise a machine and then patch its vulnerabilities to stop other players from also gaining access.  
The longer a team maintains access, the more points it gets.  
These are typically very short (typically an hour) and have strong emphasis on penetration testing. The most interesting aspect of these CTFs is that they can be livestreamed and spectated. Whats more fun than seeing hacking live!   
[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/games/koth) has been promoting and organizing these events and one can join a game every 15 minutes!  

## Categories
CTFs cover a wide spectrum of aspects related to cybersecurity and programming in general. Note that sometimes a clear distinction between category can not be made as tasks require a mixed set of skills.

### Cryptography
[Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) is a study of secrets. These CTF challenges can cover anything from some old classical cipher(aka caesar) and encodings, breaking self-rolled/poorly designed or implemented cryptographic protocols to implementing new cryptographic attacks based on recent papers/publications. These challenges can involve heavy mathematical and theoretical concepts.
