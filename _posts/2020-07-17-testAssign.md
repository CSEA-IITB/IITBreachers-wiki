This is just a test assignment,  
As you can see, this is a static site, so you would not get any points for flag submissions.  
Although you need to solve the challenge to know the flag :godmode:  
Imagine virtual pats on completing the challenges :trollface:  

## Task1
Just find the flag (you know where) and submit it to see if its correct.  
Wish you luck :sunglasses:  
<!-- inspect element rocks yo flag{congrats} -->
