This is just a test assignment,  
As you can see, this is a static site, so you would not get any points for flag submissions.  
Although you need to solve the challenge to know the flag :godmode:  
Imagine virtual pats on completing the challenges :trollface:  

## Task1
Just find the flag (you know where) and submit it to see if its correct.  
Wish you luck :sunglasses:  
<!-- inspect element rocks yo flag{congrats} -->

{% include checkflag.html %}
{% increment challengeIndex %}

## Task2 
Since you know the flag, try converting it to hex.  
<!-- 666c61677b636f6e67726174737d -->
Yeah yeah, very lame. This is just a test afterall.   
Just do the task sincerely else the octocat shall punish you :octocat:  
{% include checkflag.html %}
