This is just a test assignment,  
<!--more-->
As you can see, this is a static site, so you would not get any points for flag submissions.  
Although you need to solve the challenge to know the flag :godmode:  
Imagine virtual pats on completing the challenges :trollface:  

## Task1 
Nothing to do here, just a basic `sanity_check` :stuck_out_tongue:
{% assign index = 0 %}

{% include checkflag.html %}

## Task2
Just find the flag (you know where) and submit it to see if its correct.  
Wish you luck :sunglasses:  
<!-- inspect element rocks yo flag{congrats} -->
{% assign index = 1 %}

{% include checkflag.html %}
